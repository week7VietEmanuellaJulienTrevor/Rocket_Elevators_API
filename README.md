# TEAM WEB-2 - Week 4 & 5 Odyssey 

## Website URL: (http://rocket-elevators-trevor.tk/)

### Week 4
This is our ruby on rails project for Rocket Elevators. The goal was to make an interactive website with an original static website made during Genesis and link it to a database that can store the Employee login data and the quote data in separate tables. The website has a back office in which an employee can login to access the data from quote.

### Week 5
This is our Ruby on Rails project for our client Rocket Elevators. The goal was to implement a full-fletched backend with Rails on our original static website made for Rocket Elevators during Genesis. 

We had to store various types of data related to our customers, employees, and users in general. We used 2 main databases: one in MySQL and one in PostgreSQL. 

### The MySQL database (operational database) stores the following tables of data:
- Users 
- Customers
- Employees
- Quotes 
- Leads (Contact Us requests)
- Addresses
- Buildings
- Building Details
- Batteries
- Columns
- Elevators

### The PostgreSQL database (data warehouse) stores the following tables of data:
- FactQuotes
- FactContact
- FactElevator
- DimCustomers

Thanks to queries, the warehouse data stored in the PostgreSQL database will be able to answer these 3 questions:
1. How many contact requests are made per month?
2. How many bid solicitations are made per month?
3. How many elevators per customer do we have?


## The back-office
Our website has a dedicated back-office in which properly authenticated users can access and manage data stored in our database. To go to the login page for the back-office, go to (http://rocket-elevators-trevor.tk/admin/login).

![](https://i.gyazo.com/d6f3ca46f20f32af2afaa578f410e5e7.gif)
 
Once there, you can either login with a pre-existing account or signup with a new one.  We will authenticate your account and determine which role to attach it to, if any. What you can and cannot access in the back-office is purely determined by the role privileges you have. 

The back-office authentication is mainly done with the [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) gem.
The back-office interface itself is done with the [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) gem.

### Roles
Currently, we have 3 different types of accounts, each with different privileges and restrictions.
- Employees : 
	-	Can access & manage all tables and data inside of it. Basically has admin privileges.
-  Customers: 
	-	Can access their personal data in the following tables:
			- Customers
			- Elevators
			- Columns
			- Batteries
			- Buildings
			- Building Details
- Default guests :
	- Cannot access the back-office at all. If logged in, you are automatically redirected to the home index page of the website when you try to access the back-office.

### Accounts 
All accounts are defaulted with the password `password`.

Here's a pre-existing Employee account you could log into:
	- Email: nicolas.genest@codeboxx.biz
	- Password: `password`

Here's a pre-existing Customer account you could log into:
	- Email: ebony_hegmann@moen-moore.biz
	- Password: `password`
	
(The Customer accounts are randomly generated, and therefore they will change under a new `db:reset`.)

**These specific pre-existing accounts are subject to potential deletion in the future.

## Linked MySQL database
The MySQL database we started last week was completed this week with more tables that were seeded to simulate a functioning company with more than 40 years experience: 
1. A leads table consists of a list of all the messages and contact forms sent through the website. containing information pertaining to all the fields from the original contact form and the file is saved as a binary file.  
2. an Address table is a reference table for all the addresses used in the other tables it is linked to the customer and the buildings tables with the has_many command  
3. A customers Table references all Rocket elevators Customers and is linked the AdminUser table allowing them to connect and have a specific view. it also owns (has_many) buildings  
4. A buildings table has an address (belongs_to) and owns (has_many) building_details and also  
5. Batteries who in turn own  
6. Columns who own  
7. Elevators  
8. Finally the quote table table has been populated with data to correspond with the buildings they represent. The seed uses ruby programming language and a gem called [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) to populate the database with random data.



## Data Warehouse (w/ PostgreSQL)

 In order to be able to export data from MYSQL to POSTGRESQL you'll have to: 
 1. Browse in the the folders "lib/tasks/export.rake" and make sure that you are connected to right dbname. 
 2. Choose line 18 if you're running in you local machine or line 19 if you're running on the Codeboxx server and comment the one you're not using.  
 3. Please make sure you do the same for line "46 - 47", "66 - 67", and "89 - 90".
 4.  Go to your terminal. 
 5. Create the tables by running this commande  `rake second:db:create && rake second:db:migrate`.
 6. To export the data you'll run this second commande `rake export:datawarehouse`.
 7. Go to the POSTGRESQL terminal by typing `psql postgres`. 
 8. Type " \l" to list all your databases then " \c datawarehouse_development " to get into our database. 
 9. Type " \dt+" to list all the tables you should see " dimcustomers, factquote, factcontact, factelevator". 
 10. Type " SELECT * FROM 'name of the table you want to see' ;" don't forget the " ; " before hitting "Enter". 
 11. You will have all the data for each table.

## Queries
To analyze the business situation of the company for each month every year, we have extracted the necessary information from data warehouse (Postgresql) by using SQL queries: SELECT, SELECT distinct, FROM, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. Below are our queries to answer 6 questions:

#### 1. How many contact requests are made per month?

	select date_part('year', creation_date) as year, date_part('month', creation_date) as month, count(id)

	from factcontactC

	group by year, month

	order by year, month;

#### 2. How many bid solicitations are made per month?

	select date_part('year', creation) as year, date_part('month', creation) as month, count(id)

	from factquote

	group by year, month

	order by year, month;

#### 3. How many elevators per customer do we have?

	select company_name, sum(nb_elevator) as number_of_elevators

	from dimcustomers

	group by company_name

	order by number_of_elevators desc;

#### 4. The number of unique requests (ContactId) grouped by Month (Creation Date)?

	select distinct id, date_part('year', creation_date) as year, date_part('month', creation_date) as month

	from factcontact

	group by id, year, month

	order by year, month;

#### 5. The number of unique requests (QuoteId) grouped by Month (Creation Date)
	
	select distinct id, date_part('year', creation) as year, date_part('month', creation) as month

	from factquote

	group by id, year, month

	order by year, month;

#### 6. The number of elevators (ElevatorId) contained in the buildings belonging to each customer
	
	select customer_id, building_id, count(id)

	from factelevator

	group by building_id, customer_id

	order by building_id, customer_id;
